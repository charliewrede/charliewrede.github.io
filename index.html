      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Charlie and I am passionate about GIS and Computer Science, specifically GIS development and data science.  
         I am hoping to continue to learn more about Computer Science as I progress as a student and I hope to get a minor or Masters in Computer Science.  
         I would like to work within either the tech or environmental field because I am motivated to solve challenging and fulfilling problems that will help me to become a better programmer.</p>

      <h3>Mapping Assignment in Python</h3>
      <p>Here’s a map I made in Python of my favorite vacation spot in Sicily (Brucoli):</p>

      <h3>Temperature Change over Time in Center City, Philadelphia</h3>
      <img src="portfolio_posts/philly_temp_trend.png" 
         alt="Temperature Trend in Philadelphia">
      <p>This is a chart showing how temperature has changed in Center City, Philadelphia from 1993 to 2025. The data was specifically taken from the Franklin Institute in Center City, Philadelphia. The data type used was Temperature at the time of observation. An OLS regression model was run on the data and shows significant warming in the area at a rate of 0.17°C per year. This data is quite variable, though, so the warming could be slightly larger or smaller than what is shown here.</p>

      <h3>Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds Migration Project</h3>
      <p>Here is an interactive map showing Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds migration by month over the course of 2023:</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="portfolio_posts/migration.html" height="800">

      <p>The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is the only hummingbird inhabiting the Eastern United States. It also inhabits southern Canada and as far west as Oklahoma in the south and Alberta, Canada in the north. During migration, these birds fly south across the Gulf of Mexico and winter in southern Mexico and Central America.</p>

      <img src="303881521-480px.jpg" alt="Ruby-Throated Hummingbird" style="max-width:40%; height:auto;">

      <p>I think we can all see where the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird gets its name! The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird can beat its wings 50 times a second, allowing it to hover perfectly stationary. Its nest is also interesting — built from plant matter woven together from spiderwebs and lichen, just big enough for the mother to fit inside. A full-grown adult hummingbird only weighs 2–3 grams on average. Although they weigh practically nothing, they still migrate all the way from as far as Canada to Mexico — sometimes in a single 500-mile journey across the Gulf of Mexico! To prepare, they double their fat reserves and take advantage of favorable winds.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the map I created shows hummingbirds farther north in Canada than existing range maps suggest. Could this indicate that the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is expanding its range northward due to climate change? Or could this pattern simply reflect regional aggregation of the data? Further investigation would be needed, but it makes for an interesting research question!</p>
