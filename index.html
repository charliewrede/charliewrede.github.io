      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Charlie and I am passionate about GIS and Computer Science, specifically GIS development and data science.  
         I am hoping to continue to learn more about Computer Science as I progress as a student and I hope to get a minor or Masters in Computer Science.  
         I would like to work within either the tech or environmental field because I am motivated to solve challenging and fulfilling problems that will help me to become a better programmer.</p>

      <h3>Temperature Change over Time in Center City, Philadelphia</h3>
      <img src="portfolio_posts/philly_temp_trend.png" 
         alt="Temperature Trend in Philadelphia">
      <p>This is a chart showing how temperature has changed in Center City, Philadelphia from 1993 to 2025. The data was specifically taken from the Franklin Institute in Center City, Philadelphia. The data type used was Temperature at the time of observation. An OLS regression model was run on the data and shows significant warming in the area at a rate of 0.17°C per year. This data is quite variable, though, so the warming could be slightly larger or smaller than what is shown here.</p>

      <h3>Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds Migration Project</h3>
      <p>Here is an interactive map showing Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds migration by month over the course of 2023:</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="portfolio_posts/migration.html" height="800">

      <p>The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is the only hummingbird inhabiting the Eastern United States. They also inhabit southern Canada and as far west as Oklahoma in the south, and Alberta Canada in the north. During migration, these birds fly south across the Gulf of Mexico and winter in southern Mexico and Central America. From the map we see that the birds begin to migrate in August and most are fully south by November. They then begin to travel back north in March and April with most returning north by May. The birds in the Northern range migrate south first and come back north the latest. </p>

      <img src="303881521-480px.jpg" alt="Ruby-Throated Hummingbird" style="max-width:40%; height:auto;">

      <p>I think we can all see where the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird gets its name! The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird can beat its wings 50 times a second, allowing it to hover perfectly stationary. Its nest is also interesting, built from plant matter woven together from spiderwebs and lichen, just big enough for the mother to fit inside. A full-grown adult hummingbird only weighs 2–3 grams on average, the same wieght as a penny! Although they weigh practically nothing, they still migrate from as far as Southern Canada to Mexico. Some take single 500-mile journey across the Gulf of Mexico! To prepare, they double their fat reserves and take advantage of favorable winds.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the map I created shows hummingbirds farther north in Canada than existing range maps suggest. Could this indicate that the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is expanding its range northward due to climate change? Or could this pattern simply reflect regional aggregation of the data? Further investigation would be needed, but it makes for an interesting research question!</p>
      
      <p>These notebooks contain the Python code and data analysis for my Ruby-Throated Hummingbird migration project. Each notebook explores a different step in processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data.</p>

      <h3>NDVI & Race Inequality Analysis in Philadelphia (2020 Census + MODIS NDVI)</h3>
      <p>
        This project analyzes vegetation greenness (NDVI) across all census tracts in Philadelphia
        and compares it to racial demographics using 2020 U.S. Census data. Satellite NDVI values
        were computed using three 2021 MODIS scenes and averaged to produce a mean NDVI for each tract.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this analysis was to explore whether predominantly White, Black, Latino,
        or Asian neighborhoods in Philadelphia experience different levels of vegetation cover — 
        an important environmental justice indicator.
      </p>

      <h4>Methodology</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Loaded 2010 Census tract geometries for Philadelphia County.</li>
        <li>Downloaded 2020 Census PL94 race data via the Census API.</li>
        <li>Loaded and processed MODIS NDVI rasters (16-day composites).</li>
        <li>Computed tract-level mean NDVI using zonal statistics.</li>
        <li>Generated correlation plots for:
          <ul>
            <li>% White vs NDVI</li>
            <li>% Black vs NDVI</li>
            <li>% Asian vs NDVI</li>
            <li>% Latino (Hispanic) vs NDVI</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Compared groups using a boxplot of majority-race tracts.</li>
      </ul>


      <h4>NDVI vs % White Population</h4>

      <h4>NDVI vs % Black Population</h4>

      <h4>NDVI vs % Asian Population</h4>

      <h4>NDVI vs % Latino Population</h4>
      <!-- Insert scatterplot image here -->
      <img src="portfolio_posts/ndvi_latino_scatter.png" alt="NDVI vs Latino Population" />


      <h4>Mean NDVI by Majority Race Group</h4>
      <!-- Insert boxplot image here -->
      <img src="portfolio_posts/ndvi_majority_boxplot.png" alt="NDVI by Majority Race Group" />

      <p>
        <b>Interpretation:</b>  
        NDVI values generally ranged from 0.25–0.55 across Philadelphia, which is typical for an urban–suburban
        environment with a mix of tree canopy, parks, sidewalks, and built infrastructure.  
        Across racial groups, the differences in NDVI were small and correlations were close to zero,
        suggesting no strong relationship between racial composition and vegetation greenness at the census-tract scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        The boxplot comparing majority-White, majority-Black, majority-Latino, and majority-Asian neighborhoods 
        shows modest variation but no clear environmental disparity in vegetation cover according to this dataset 
        and time window. Additional factors such as income, zoning, tree canopy data, or longitudinal NDVI could 
        provide deeper insight.
