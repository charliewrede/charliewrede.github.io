      <h3>Temperature Change over Time in Center City, Philadelphia</h3>
      <img src="portfolio_posts/philly_temp_trend.png" 
         alt="Temperature Trend in Philadelphia">
      <p>This is a chart showing how temperature has changed in Center City, Philadelphia from 1993 to 2025. The data was specifically taken from the Franklin Institute in Center City, Philadelphia. The data type used was Temperature at the time of observation. An OLS regression model was run on the data and shows significant warming in the area at a rate of 0.17°C per year. This data is quite variable, though, so the warming could be slightly larger or smaller than what is shown here.</p>

      <h3>Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds Migration Project</h3>
      <p>Here is an interactive map showing Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds migration by month over the course of 2023:</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="portfolio_posts/migration.html" height="800">

      <p>The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is the only hummingbird inhabiting the Eastern United States. They also inhabit southern Canada and as far west as Oklahoma in the south, and Alberta Canada in the north. During migration, these birds fly south across the Gulf of Mexico and winter in southern Mexico and Central America. From the map we see that the birds begin to migrate in August and most are fully south by November. They then begin to travel back north in March and April with most returning north by May. The birds in the Northern range migrate south first and come back north the latest. </p>

      <img src="303881521-480px.jpg" alt="Ruby-Throated Hummingbird" style="max-width:40%; height:auto;">

      <p>I think we can all see where the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird gets its name! The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird can beat its wings 50 times a second, allowing it to hover perfectly stationary. Its nest is also interesting, built from plant matter woven together from spiderwebs and lichen, just big enough for the mother to fit inside. A full-grown adult hummingbird only weighs 2–3 grams on average, the same wieght as a penny! Although they weigh practically nothing, they still migrate from as far as Southern Canada to Mexico. Some take single 500-mile journey across the Gulf of Mexico! To prepare, they double their fat reserves and take advantage of favorable winds.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the map I created shows hummingbirds farther north in Canada than existing range maps suggest. Could this indicate that the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is expanding its range northward due to climate change? Or could this pattern simply reflect regional aggregation of the data? Further investigation would be needed, but it makes for an interesting research question!</p>
      
      <p>These notebooks contain the Python code and data analysis for my Ruby-Throated Hummingbird migration project. Each notebook explores a different step in processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data.</p>

      <h3>NDVI & Race Inequality Analysis in Philadelphia (2020 Census + MODIS NDVI)</h3>
      <p>
        This project analyzes vegetation greenness (NDVI) across all census tracts in Philadelphia
        and compares it to racial demographics using 2020 U.S. Census data. Satellite NDVI values
        were computed using three 2021 MODIS scenes and averaged to produce a mean NDVI for each tract.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this analysis was to explore whether majority White, Black, Latino,
        or Asian neighborhoods in Philadelphia experience different levels of vegetation cover. 
      </p>

      <h4>Methodology</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Loaded 2010 Census tract geometries for Philadelphia County.</li>
        <li>Downloaded 2020 Census racial demographics data via the Census API.</li>
        <li>Loaded and processed MODIS NDVI rasters.</li>
        <li>Computed tract-level mean NDVI using zonal statistics.</li>
        <li>Built correlation plots for:
          <ul>
            <li>% White vs NDVI</li>
            <li>% Black vs NDVI</li>
            <li>% Asian vs NDVI</li>
            <li>% Latino (Hispanic) vs NDVI</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Compared groups using a boxplot of majority-race tracts.</li>
      </ul>


      <h4>NDVI vs % White Population</h4>

      <h4>NDVI vs % Black Population</h4>

      <h4>NDVI vs % Latino Population</h4>

      <img src="portfolio_posts/Latino.png" alt="NDVI vs Latino Population" />


      <h4>Mean NDVI by Majority Race Group</h4>
      <!-- Insert boxplot image here -->
      <img src="portfolio_posts/Boxplot.png" alt="NDVI by Majority Race Group" />

      <p>
        <b>Summary:</b>  
        NDVI values generally ranged from 0.25–0.55 across Philadelphia, which is typical for an urban/suburban
        environment. 
        Across racial groups, the differences in NDVI for White and Black populations were small and correlations were close to zero,
        suggesting no strong relationship between racial composition and vegetation greenness at the census-tract scale. Asian and Latino
        populations however did show negative correlations, however they had far less neighborhoods with majorities (Asian: 1 and Latino: 23)
        this probably suggests an issue with aggregation/standardization which I think I'll look into. However I would say the Latino correlation 
        is interesting as there are more data points there.
      </p>

      <p>
        The boxplot comparing majority White, majority Black, majority Latino, and majority Asian neighborhoods shows little variation between 
        White and Black neighborhoods and some with Latino and a lot with Asian. The Latino and Asian correlations do seem to be largely true as 
        historically Latino and Asian nieghborhoods are generally in urban areas with little greenery. However Black and White populations show 
        no correlation. I did find this interesting. Upon some research on the internet. I realized  the main reason is due to a large white 
        population in South Philadelphia, this area is quite urban with a low NDVI and is known for it's large Italian and Irish American 
        populations. I can confirm this as an Italian American from Philadelphia. I also noticed that in North West Philadelphia there are large areas
        with a majority black population and high NDVI values. This is interesting as uptown and Mount airy (that area) are known for there middle class
        black neighborhoods, suggesting income could be a useful addition to the analysis. 
        This begs the question do White and Black people live in largely equal NDVI areas or did I aggregate the areas incorrectly? Further research must 
        also be conducted on Latino and Asian communities negative correlations to see if there is possible reasons for environmental injustice.
        Heres the link to the NDVI maps and racial maps from the internet:

        Race: (data is from 2010 but it does show majorities by census block which is helpful and helps to compare easier)
