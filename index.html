         alt="Temperature Trend in Philadelphia">
      <p>This is a chart showing how temperature has changed in Center City, Philadelphia from 1993 to 2025. The data was specifically taken from the Franklin Institute in Center City, Philadelphia. The data type used was Temperature at the time of observation. An OLS regression model was run on the data and shows significant warming in the area at a rate of 0.17°C per year. This data is quite variable, though, so the warming could be slightly larger or smaller than what is shown here.</p>

      <h3>Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds Migration Project</h3>
      <p>Here is an interactive map showing Ruby-Throated Hummingbirds migration by month over the course of 2023:</p>
      <embed type="text/html" src="portfolio_posts/migration.html" height="800">

      <p>The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is the only hummingbird inhabiting the Eastern United States. They also inhabit southern Canada and as far west as Oklahoma in the south, and Alberta Canada in the north. During migration, these birds fly south across the Gulf of Mexico and winter in southern Mexico and Central America. From the map we see that the birds begin to migrate in August and most are fully south by November. They then begin to travel back north in March and April with most returning north by May. The birds in the Northern range migrate south first and come back north the latest. </p>

      <img src="303881521-480px.jpg" alt="Ruby-Throated Hummingbird" style="max-width:40%; height:auto;">

      <p>I think we can all see where the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird gets its name! The Ruby-Throated Hummingbird can beat its wings 50 times a second, allowing it to hover perfectly stationary. Its nest is also interesting, built from plant matter woven together from spiderwebs and lichen, just big enough for the mother to fit inside. A full-grown adult hummingbird only weighs 2–3 grams on average, the same wieght as a penny! Although they weigh practically nothing, they still migrate from as far as Southern Canada to Mexico. Some take single 500-mile journey across the Gulf of Mexico! To prepare, they double their fat reserves and take advantage of favorable winds.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, the map I created shows hummingbirds farther north in Canada than existing range maps suggest. Could this indicate that the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird is expanding its range northward due to climate change? Or could this pattern simply reflect regional aggregation of the data? Further investigation would be needed, but it makes for an interesting research question!</p>
      
      <p>These notebooks contain the Python code and data analysis for my Ruby-Throated Hummingbird migration project. Each notebook explores a different step in processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data.</p>

      <h3>NDVI & Race Inequality Analysis in Philadelphia (2020 Census + MODIS NDVI)</h3>
      <p>
        This project analyzes vegetation greenness (NDVI) across all census tracts in Philadelphia
        and compares it to racial demographics using 2020 U.S. Census data. Satellite NDVI values
        were computed using three 2021 MODIS scenes and averaged to produce a mean NDVI for each tract.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of this analysis was to explore whether majority White, Black, Latino,
        or Asian neighborhoods in Philadelphia experience different levels of vegetation cover. 
      </p>

      <h4>Methodology</h4>

      <p>
      This project integrates satellite-derived vegetation data (NDVI) with 2020 U.S. Census racial
      demographics to explore possible environmental inequalities across Philadelphia neighborhoods. 
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li><b>Census Tract Geometry:</b> Loaded 2010 census tract boundaries for Philadelphia County from OpenDataPhilly.</li>

          <li><b>Demographic Data:</b> Used 2020 Census PL 94-171 racial data via the U.S. Census API. The data contained counts for 
          White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino residents. I converted all the counts to percentages.</li>

      <li><b>MODIS NDVI Processing:</b> Loaded multiple 2023 MOD13Q1 NDVI scenes using rioxarray. Applied MODIS scaling factors 
        and filtered out invalid pixels. Computed a mean NDVI raster across all dates.</li>

      <li><b>Zonal Statistics:</b> For each census tract, I clipped the NDVI raster and calculated mean NDVI. 
      </li>

      <li><b>Correlation Analysis:</b> Produced scatterplots comparing NDVI to each racial group's proportional population share.</li>

      <li><b>Majority-Group Analysis:</b> Identified majority-White, majority-Black, majority-Asian, and majority-Latino tracts 
      and compared their vegetation levels via a boxplot.</li>

      <li><b>Bivariate Choropleth Maps:</b> Created four maps combining NDVI and racial percentages using a 3×3 color matrix.
      Each map visualizes joint patterns of vegetation (Low–High) and racial concentration (Low–High):
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

      <h4>White Population % vs NDVI</h4>
      <img src="portfolio_posts/White_vs_NDVI (2).png" alt="Bivariate Map White Population vs NDVI" />

      <p>
        <b>Summary:</b>  
        NDVI values generally ranged from 0.25–0.55 across Philadelphia, which is typical for an urban/suburban
        environment. 
        Across racial groups, the differences in NDVI for White and Black populations were small and correlations were close to zero,
        suggesting no strong relationship between racial composition and vegetation greenness at the census tract scale. Asian and Latino
        populations however did show negative correlation. This shows that there is less greenness and general vegatation in these communities 
        and this should be considered as a characteristic of Environmental Justice. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The boxplot comparing majority White, majority Black, majority Latino, and majority Asian neighborhoods shows little variation between 
        White and Black neighborhoods and some with Latino and a lot with Asian communities. The Latino and Asian correlations do seem to be largely true as 
        historically Latino and Asian nieghborhoods are generally in urban areas with little greenery. However Black and White populations show 
        no correlation. I did find this interesting. Upon making the maps, I realized  the main reason is due to a large white 
        population in South Philadelphia, this area is quite urban with a low NDVI and is known for it's large Italian and Irish American 
        populations. I also noticed that in North West and West Philadelphia there are large areas with a majority black population and high NDVI
        values. I also did some research and found that there are many greenspace initiatives for black and brown communities in Philadelphia and
        
        I wonder if the positive correlation for black communities is in part due to these initiatives like this one done by Penn:
        https://communityimpact.pennmedicine.org/greening-for-health-equity-in-black-and-brown-communities/
        While for majority Asian and Latino nighborhoods theres not many neighborhoods with high NDVI values and I think these green space initiatives 
        should also try to push for more greenspace initiatives in these communities too, based upon my analysis.
