Biography: Hello! My name is Charlie and I am passionate about GIS and Computer Science and specifically in GIS development and datascience. I am hoping to continue to learn more about Computer Science as I progress as a student and hope to get a minor and possibly a Bachelors or Masters in Computer Science. I also would like to work within either the tech or environmental field. This is because I am motivated to solve the most difficult and fulfilling problems I can that will help me to become a better programmer.

Heres a video showing what GIS is!
